Replication Package for Hurricane Damage Nowcasts Paper

Note that the code is a mix of R code and Ox code (which requires Ox Professional to run some of the packages).

The data underyling the analysis is in the data folder. Some of the data processing is done in the codes here but generating of the real-time vintages and cleaning of them was done elsewhere.

If any of the data in this repository is used elsewhere then please be sure and cite the original paper. See the paper as well as Martinez (2020) for details on the data descriptions.
